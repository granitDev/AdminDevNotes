System Design Process

Conduct a needs assessment:
    What are the goals of the project?
    Who are the stakeholders in this project?
        Who:
            requested the new system?
            will use the system after it's installed?
            has the authority to approve funds for the project?
            has authority to allocate my time to the project?
            must give final approval to this project before it can begin?
            will maintain and support the system?
        When is the system needed?

Select a distribution:
    Will the system function as a workstation of a server?
    Does the distribution offer support?
    Will the application you need run on this distribution?

Verify hardware compatibility
    Check the HCL
    Check if the UEFI will allow boot into Linux
    x86_64, or other?

Plan file system
    file system selection
        ext2
        ext3
        ext4
        Reiser
        btrfs
    Essential Partitions,
        swap
            Desktop need 1.5x RAM size
            Workstation needs 2x RAM size
            Servers need 1x RAM
        /
            If there is not /home partition, make this take up the rest of the drive
            Else make this at least 12GB as it needs to hold all system updates
    RECOMMENDED Additional Partitions for System Stability
        /home
            Use the entire space leftover from the other partitions
        /var
            20GB min
    Best practice but not essential
        /boot
            100 - 200 MB
        /opt
        /tmp
            1 - 2 GB in size
        /usr
            20GB min

Select essential software packages
    Install only what is needed to do the job and nothing more

Identify necessary user accounts
    /root is allways created
    /home
        the rest of the users are in here

Gather network information
    Workstations: DHCP
    Server: Static IP
        IP address
        Subnet make
        Router address
        DNS server address
    Hostname
    DNS domain
    Firewall
        Open appropriatepPorts

Select an installation source
    Installing remotely from a network server
    Installing from internet
    Install from CD or USB
