# Setting up the library #
##########################

	button at the bottom right

	- Make the library linkable -
	-----------------------------
	
1.	In the .pro file add this at the very top:

	if(!load(gm-lib)) {
			error("libraryName not set correctly");
	}

2.	This requires an overall .pri file to be setup, as well as an gm-lib.prf
	to be setup in order to work

3.	Go to the folder where the other library .prf files are and copy one of them
	and rename it to match your library

4.	Edit the contents of the .prf file as needed to point to your library

######################
# Setting up a class #
######################

1.	Create a class under your library as you normally would.

2.	In the Headers folder should be a header that is titled something like "libraryName_global.h"

3.	Open the header file of your class and include the global file.

4.	Open the global header file. Inside you should see something like:

	#  define LIBRARYNAMESHARED_EXPORT QDECL_EXPORT

	Copy the text that resembles "LIBRARYNAMESHARED_EXPORT"

5.	Open your header file and past the coppied text before your class name to redefine the class:

	class LIBRARYNAMESHARED_EXPORT MyClass : public QWidget

###################
 That should do it
