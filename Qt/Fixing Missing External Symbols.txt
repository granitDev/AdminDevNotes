1) Ensure the .pro file has all the CONFIG += options required for externally called classes

2) For files from different parts of the tree, make sure those files are properly exported
in their header files with the proper XXXX_global.h file and that their class structure has 
the correct modifier from the global file

3) Check actual file loaction of the compiled exe's and dlls. If they are not where expected
change the .pro file of the calling class to point to the correct location, or change the .pro
of the called class so that it is compiled to the correct location
